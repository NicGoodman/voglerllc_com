For correct retaining wall design and function, the interplay of many issues such as costs, performance, aesthetics, and resale value all come to bear in a way that can seem overwhelming. Add to that required engineering, permitting, and often-rigid HOA guidelines and you have the recipe for serious confusion. <br /><br />Let us help you navigate the choices available so we can design and build the retaining wall that best suits your home and lifestyle. From component walls (MSE or Mechanically Stabilized Earth), to boulder creations, to poured concrete, we can help you make sense of the available options in a manner that fits your needs and maximizes your budget.<br /><br />Each year our company alone devotes over 30 percent of our excavation workload to costly mitigation projects, many of these retaining wall failures. Soils and weather in our mountain region are notoriously volatile, while permitting requirements are insufficient to ensure performance and longevity. Additionally, contractors usually know more about home construction than structural retention and often cut corners to soften budgetary overruns. <br /><br />Consider that a wall failure usually entails three times the cost of a correctly installed wall – it assumes the cost of the original wall, the cost of demolition and clean-up, and the cost of the new wall. We\u0027ve never had a failure of any kind and take great pride in the correct execution and durability of our walls."}},"new2":{"type":"card","enabled":"1","fields":{"cardImage":[{"elementType":"craft\\elements\\Asset","filename":"concrete6.jpg","folder":"Local","source":"local"}],"cardHeader":"Retaining Wall Collapse","cardContent":"","cardBackgroundColor":["bg-yellow-vv"]}},"new3":{"type":"card","enabled":"1","fields":{"cardImage":[{"elementType":"craft\\elements\\Asset","filename":"concrete9.jpg","folder":"Local","source":"local"}],"cardHeader":"Demolition & Cleanup","cardContent":"","cardBackgroundColor":["bg-orange-vv"]}},"new4":{"type":"card","enabled":"1","fields":{"cardImage":[{"elementType":"craft\\elements\\Asset","filename":"concretewall5.jpg","folder":"Local","source":"local"}],"cardHeader":"New Wall Footing","cardContent":"","cardBackgroundColor":["bg-green-vv"]}},"new5":{"type":"card","enabled":"1","fields":{"cardImage":[{"elementType":"craft\\elements\\Asset","filename":"concrete-wall.jpg","folder":"Local","source":"local"}],"cardHeader":"Freshly Poured Wall","cardContent":"","cardBackgroundColor":["bg-orange-vv"]}},"new6":{"type":"card","enabled":"1","fields":{"cardImage":[{"elementType":"craft\\elements\\Asset","filename":"IMG_20130411_122518_836-1.jpg","folder":"Local","source":"local"}],"cardHeader":"Compaction & Drainage","cardContent":"","cardBackgroundColor":["bg-yellow-vv"]}},"new7":{"type":"card","enabled":"1","fields":{"cardImage":[{"elementType":"craft\\elements\\Asset","filename":"retainingwallconcrete.jpeg","folder":"Local","source":"local"}],"cardHeader":"Finished Product","cardContent":"","cardBackgroundColor":["bg-green-vv"]}}}}}}},{"slug":"test-1","section":"portfolio","sites":{"default":{"slug":"test-1","section":"portfolio","enabled":"1","site":"default","enabledForSite":"1","postDate":{"date":"2019-03-18 10:35:00.000000","timezone_type":3,"timezone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"expiryDate":null,"title":"Pond Building Project, Sevier County TN","entryType":"portfolio","fields":{"heroImage":[{"elementType":"craft\\elements\\Asset","filename":"seviercopond-315x315.jpg","folder":"Local","source":"local"}],"heroText":"Pond Building Project, Sevier County TN","pageHeader":"Pond Building Project, Sevier County TN","pageIntro":"Over the years we have successfully completed a number of building ponds in TNland improvements on a 46-acre property in Sevier County TN.

The large maples, locust and poplars along the creek were felled and hauled for firewood. Brush was stacked for later chipping and top soils were wind-rowed behind the levee area for future re-vegetation around the pond. On day three senior operator Archie Boone began channeling the existing spring path to ensure water stayed below the future pond bottom. Shortly after, he began carving material from the core, the section of the dam below the bottom of the pond which serves to lock the dam in place. This is the crucial portion of the dam most folks fail to correctly construct.<br /><br />After the levee core was correctly compacted we installed 120’ of 6” pvc pipe in the re-contoured spring channel for the future “stand-pipe” and began carving “lifts’ of dirt from the pond basin area and placing them over the pipe. Each lift was meticulously spread and compacted and soon the basic shape of the dam began to appear. Because the pond lies on gently sloping ground a large portion of the excavation needed to happen below our initial grade. In other words, we were digging a giant hole. In doing so the perimeter contour of the pond began to emerge. As anticipated we also uncovered higher quantities of clay as we carved material from the pond bottom.<br /><br />Despite heavy rains that twice turned the site into a quagmire the pond was constructed inside three weeks. The stand pipe, complete with a custom clean-out flapper valve and stainless steel drain chain was installed after all contouring was completed. The top of the vertical pipe was set to the static pond level. The pond slowly began to fill. Final touches, including external finish grading, constructing a wide overflow notch beside the levee and re-vegetation occurred while the water level rose. The pond will soon be stocked and landscaped.

A dedicated novice or project manager can potentially do as good a job as a professional in one of the relevant fields if they have good communication skills, are detail-oriented and willing to learn some basic technical requirements. Often architects, engineers, builders, homeowners etc. think in a fashion reminiscent of the fabled men who, blindfolded, described the parts of an elephant in entirely different ways. While each profession must bring valuable insight to the project, each must serve the larger site preparation process as a whole.

Builders are often accountable for its success or failure but this can be more of a problem than a solution. Builders are usually “house-centric” and generally much more comfortable with the actual home construction than the somewhat esoteric science of site prep. On numerous occasions we have seen expressions of great relief on the part of builders after suggesting that we work directly with the designer, engineer and client on the site prep. Often builders simply inherit a process that began prior to their arrival and without their input. The grading contractor usually ends up in the same boat. They may have decades of earthwork experience but they are there on a “low price bid” to do a given number of tasks with little creative input. All end up being subservient to a hurried momentum and preset budget even when they appear to have autonomy. This results in the omission of essential planning steps and ultimately mistakes. Who ends up in charge? The budget. The bottom line overwhelms real value and the process becomes, as my seven year old says, “mangalated”.<br />"}},"new4":{"type":"text","enabled":"1","fields":{"heading":"So What Can Be Done To Ensure Your Site Prep Is Successful?","text":"You have your land or lot and now you want to begin the building process. The first step in site preparation is site assessment. Site assessment should include all relevant aspects of your land and not merely your building footprint. Our company uses basic digital mapping techniques to create multi-layered site maps, often of entire properties. This allows us to look at your land as a whole. Map layers include topographical profiles, high resolution aerial photography, soils identification, timber assessments, riparian and wetland demarcations, access, previous land use, adjacent property lines and more. Mapping is cheap and provides a starting point for all parties involved. It creates good general orientation on the ground. It is not, however, a substitute for good “on site” investigation. There is no substitute for familiarity. It is necessary to be able to see and walk your site. If it is too overgrown you should underbrush it. This will assist everyone involved and, where forestry mulching is appropriate, provides basic erosion control and soil protection from the outset.<br />"}},"new5":{"type":"text","enabled":"1","fields":{"heading":"Know You Planning Requirements","text":"Another component of thorough site assessment is gaining an understanding of relevant planning and zoning requirements. Development guidelines sometimes extend all the way from national requisites, mandated by the Clean Water Act, down to individual subdivision covenants governing minimum square footage and specific design elements. In addition, municipalities have basic rules regarding setbacks (proximity of structures to adjacent property lines, public roads, utilities etc). Some also have steep slope ordinances requiring sites within certain parameters be subject to additional design requirements such as stability analysis, maximum allowable de-vegetation, building height etc. Remember to also check with your local utilities. Most have very specific guidelines regarding services for new homes. All these requirements must be factored into the design process from the outset. To do otherwise, as we have have seen on many occasions, always contributes to confusion, delays and cost over-runs.<br />"}},"new6":{"type":"text","enabled":"1","fields":{"heading":"Time To Develop Site Documents","text":"Assuming your future building area is now accessible the formal process of creating site prep documents should begin. It is time to develop a higher quality survey or DEM (Digital Elevation Model) of all impacted areas. These survey maps generally work off two foot contour lines so that engineers, architects and grading contractors can make accurate calculations and work swiftly. DEM’s are created by surveyors working for you or your selected builder, architect or engineer. These more refined maps capitalize on previous mapping efforts but focus on the building area, even down to individual trees, springs, rock outcroppings and specific soil analysis, the latter of which is absolutely essential.<br /><br />Inadequate soil analysis is more responsible for site failure in the mountains than any other single factor. Soil related issues, especially erosion, wall, foundation and slope failures, account for a huge percentage of our mitigation work. Some soil complexes, such as colluvials and micatious soils, are simply unsuitable for construction. We recommend clients employ the services of a reputable geotechnical engineer to “at least” examine their site prior to the creation of construction documents. Geotechnical services, from basic site walks to complete borings and analysis, are typically not expensive and can ensure your site and building design are appropriate from the start. You don’t want to be nearing the completion of your home (and budget) only to find out you need a $ 50,000 retaining wall or foundation fix.<br /><br />Once your contour survey and geotechnical investigation are complete the process of designing the home in a way that integrates it into the land can begin. You, your designer, engineer, grading contractor and builder, and later various subcontractors such as electrical, gas, HVAC and plumbing, can work off the same page. Often we are presented with house plans purchased from builders’ portfolios or internet sites. The idea is simple, to eliminate design costs and speed up the process. This seldom works in reality. House plans floating on a white page must ultimately be grounded firmly on Mother Earth. We are called upon to evaluate and correct tens of thousands of dollars worth of mistakes associated with this foolish shortcut annually. Nevertheless, we encounter this failed notion on an almost daily basis. At the very least, the lack of complete and/or unintegrated site documents creates big cost overruns and second rate solutions.<br />"}},"new7":{"type":"text","enabled":"1","fields":{"heading":"What Kind Of Site Documents Do I Need And How Do I Get Them?","text":"Hire a local architect to design your home or modify your chosen plans. The money you spend on a skilled local architect or designer will come back to you in many ways once actual construction has begun. A good architect will be familiar local planning and zoning guidelines and will also connect you with local resources, including respected builders and material suppliers. The process of working with an architect informs more than just the look and feel of the home. Crucial issues such as positioning, (especially for solar installation and view sheds), access, structural retention (walls), drainage, rough and finish grading, revegetation, landscaping and more are addressed. You are paying your designer to leverage their skills and experience on behalf of your future living experience and budget. Better yet, bring pictures, sketches, ideas etc. to the table. Learn as much as you can. Ask the stupid questions. Listen. Demand deadlines be met. And, above all, keep the process moving. A good architect will be a tremendous asset and resource for you and your builder.<br /><br />After all, you are working towards a set of finished renditions or “elevations” that portray all aspects of your home on paper as it should look on your land. A complete set of construction elevations provides valuable calculations and visualization for everyone involved in the construction process. They allow for superior task consolidation and better communication. As an example, accurate grading elevations or grading plans, such as those created by architects and civil engineers, provide static benchmarks, show graders where and how much soil to excavate and/or fill, where to install erosion control, how to construct necessary access, what finished slopes and walls are desired, where septic, water, gas, electrical and IT lines should be placed and much more.

Resist the advice to simply allow the builder to use his “regular guys’. or to just throw the plans out into the world for the cheapest bid. An experienced grader usually has a better feel for the tasks associated with site prep than anyone else, in particular native soils, hydrology, specific materials and overall costs. Find a reliable excavation contractor with an impressive portfolio and solid recommendations. Have him or her walk through the excavation process with you and your builder, and even take you to an ongoing project. A well run site has a sense of industry and precision far different from a poorly run one. For the most the prevailing paradigm dictates that grading contractors works as subcontractors under builders. This is often a poor arrangement as most builders don’t have professional grading experience. In many cases a good grader can make major modifications to your plans: correcting oversights, cutting costs and improving the overall outcome. In addition, it is often wise to include a local arborist. Where sites are heavily vegetated it will be necessary to determine which trees must be removed and which must be protected.

In many cases the inclusion of a landscape architect provides the finishing touch. We generally believe at least 10% of a total building budget should be retained for landscaping. By landscaping we are referring to much more than flowers, bushes and lighting. We are speaking of the way in which your home fits its specific landform and ecological niche as well as important structural elements such as soil management, revegetation, drainage and structural retention. We are referring to your outdoor living, privacy and interface with other living beings. A skilled landscape architect works hand in hand with you, your home designer, engineer and builder, employing the same maps and data to create the finished look of the home.

We suggest participants schedule conference calls to discuss their project. Conference calls are an inexpensive and effective way to bring all thoughts and opinions to bear.

This degree of exactitude is worth striving for. It pays you back in multiple ways. Your construction moves much more swiftly with fewer uncertainties. Mistakes and oversights are caught in the planning phase. Subcontractors are able to bid or estimate within tighter margins. Ultimately your house is both more livable and more valuable.

For starters don’t build on land that is too steep, has poor access or volatile soils. Many buyers fall for view lots with poor access, a major pitfall. Create a house design that compliments your land. Don’t attempt to bend Mother Nature to your will. As a rule, the higher the site prep budget, the farther you have strayed from your site’s native design constraints. When deciding on a designer do your homework. Talk with previous clients and visit their homes if possible. Shrink your footprint by at least 20 percent. Americans build the largest houses in the world. Cutting your footprint down saves big bucks from the ground up and allows more money for fine finish work and landscaping. Finally, make certain your builder has a skilled systems designer who deeply understands modern heating, cooling and insulation techniques. Good mechanical design contributes mightily to livability, value and long term cost savings.<br />"}},"new13":{"type":"text","enabled":"1","fields":{"heading":"Site Prep Basics In Conclusion","text":"There are really only a few basic rules that must be followed to guarantee successful site preparation:<br /><br />Make your land accessible and conduct a thorough site assessment. Map your property to gain a better general perspective. Be especially diligent regarding soil analysis. Hire a geotechnical engineer to evaluate your site, especially if it is steep, wet or rocky.<br /><br />Understand all applicable planning and zoning requirements and ordinances. This includes those prescribed by your local utilities. Ignorance will not be an excuse once boots and tracks hit the ground.<br /><br />Hire a local architect or designer and build a team that includes all relevant professionals (grading contractor, civil engineer, arborist, landscape designer etc.) Keep the process moving! Use conference calls for this purpose. Site preparation is an iterative process with lots of opportunity for “balls to be dropped.” Remember, a team without a leader is no team at all.<br /><br />Work towards complete visualization of your home as it will appear when finished. Create the documentation that allows this, i.e. DEMs, complete construction elevations, grading plans and landscape drawings.<br /><br />Educate yourself regarding sustainable design and basic construction methods. Learn a bit about technical matters such as: foundation design, structural retention, HVAC and utility hook-ups, alternative power, driveway placement, septic installation etc.<br /><br />Most importantly, Listen!

A dam with slopes that are too steep is a recipe for neglect and failure.<br /><br />Stand pipe and overflow systems are generally the next points of failure. The purpose of the former is to regulate water level. The latter provides an evacuation route for excess during extreme weather or standpipe failure. For larger ponds/lakes, or for dams that will double as roadways, concrete or buried drainage structures with head wall protection are advisable for overflows. All should be engineered for your specific environment and circumstances.<br />","cardBackgroundColor":["bg-orange-vv"]}},"new4":{"type":"card","enabled":"1","fields":{"cardImage":[{"elementType":"craft\\elements\\Asset","filename":"lakepond.jpg","folder":"Local","source":"local"}],"cardHeader":"The Devil\u0027s in the Details","cardContent":"There are many aspects of pond building that must be attended to to assure success. Remember, a healthy pond is one that creates a positive ecological impact, providing habitat not only for aquatic species, but nearly every type of creature from bugs to birds. For this reason, your choice of vegetation around your pond is crucial. Create a substantial buffer around your pond by planting native grasses, trees and shrubs.<br /><br />Where fish are concerned, make sure you choose appropriate species and correct stocking rates for your conditions. Your local USDA or wildlife agent can usually help with this. Consider building gravel-lined shelves into the pond sides for bedding. Create shelter for fish by placing boulders or dropping in old pallets tied together. Remember, a healthy aquatic environment has abundant oxygen, a correct pH range (slightly alkaline), and is devoid of damaging invasive vegetation.<br /><br />Depending on where you plan to build your pond and how it is to be designed you may require one or more permits.

To make matters worse RM had just finished the parking area in a mix of asphalt and custom pavers. We explained the various issues to RM and his wife E and immediately addressed costs. The project would easily top $100,000. RM, a successful executive, listened thoughtfully. After negotiations and further site visits we began staging in early May.

In layman’s terms they violated all basic wall building principles. They also contained stumps, trees and other vegetative material, a big No-No. In addition, the walls were outwardly battered, which gave the menacing sense of inevitable failure seen in the photos. The expansive upper parking area was adequate for staging but required extensive protection and extreme care. The existing walls contained only about two thirds the amount of rock required to complete the project. Finally, all the homes infrastructure, power, phone, septic and drainage lines were buried precariously below the lower wall and would necessitate removal and reconfiguration.

As the upper wall was completed lower wall footings and new utility routes were dug, the lower access road was cut and boulders were staged within easy reach of the big Link Belt excavator. As a way to maximize stone and assist handling, the largest boulders were split with feathers and wedges in traditional masonry fashion.

It would also limit the impact on the farm as almost no field acreage would be disturbed by driveway construction. The problem was the dam itself. The levee, although correctly built, was narrow along the top and would require an enormous quantity of fill dirt to support a proper driveway (i.e. 14 feet of width). Initial estimates for the importation of fill dirt put the driveway project out of reach financially. After some discussion it was decided we would harvest fill along the road corridor with only the bulldozer and hope for the best. This was a risky plan, due to shallow soils and the high probability of hitting subsurface rock. If we were starved for fill dirt and required to import via dump truck, or stage a track hoe to harvest from another location on the farm, costs would increase dramatically.
